<h2>Java Tools Required for <span style="font-style: italic;">Understaning
Electron Devices</span></h2>
The&nbsp;text uses a protocol for delivering executable Java&nbsp;codes
called Java Web Start to launch the live figures. &nbsp;Oracle (which
owns the original Sun Microsystems Java rights) removed this facility
after Java version 1.8 (in 2017). &nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, an
open-source version of Web Start has recently (as of 2021)&nbsp; become
available. &nbsp;Please download it f rom: <a href="https://openwebstart.com/download/">https://openwebstart.com/download/</a>&nbsp;and
install it on your system. &nbsp;Open Web Start (OWS) will then be
associated with the *.jnlp file-type, and will atuomatically launch the
program codes specified in the jnlp file. &nbsp;OWS invokes the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) that is installed on your computer.<br>
<br>
Adobe has also disabled the mechanism that permits external files to be
launched from within Acrobat Reader. &nbsp;The best solution that I
have found is to use the Foxit PDF reader instead, to view the textbook
(UndElDev.pdf) and the lecture slides (UEDfoils.pdf). &nbsp;The Foxit
reader can be downloaded from: <a href="https://www.foxit.com/downloads/">https://www.foxit.com/downloads/</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;Install this software, open the reader and go to File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Trust Manager and uncheck <span style="font-style: italic;">Enable Safe Reading Mode</span>. &nbsp;<br>
<br>

Some figures require the Java3D extensions, which should be
automatically downloaded to your computer through the OWS
system. &nbsp;There may be an issue with the 32 versus 64 JRE software.
&nbsp;If you have problems with a 64-bit installation, try the 32-bit
version of Java.<br>
<br>
Users of Apple computers may encounter security restrictions placed
upon executable codes that have not been obtained through the Apple
website. &nbsp;To date this seems to be a problem with codes that are
directly run from a Java executable (JAR) file, but I would not be
surprised to see problems with OWS in the future. &nbsp;Instructions on
how to disable these protections can be found at: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491</a>&nbsp;.<br>
